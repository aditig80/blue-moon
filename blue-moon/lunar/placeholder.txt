The moonlight cascaded over the silent valley, casting shadows across the grass. Birds flapped their wings, soaring above the towering trees, while the wind whispered through the branches. The air was crisp, tinged with the scent of pine. A distant stream babbled softly, weaving its way through the rocks. In the distance, the stars twinkled like scattered diamonds in the velvet sky. Each breath was a fleeting moment, lost in the vastness of the night. Beneath it all, the world felt still, suspended in time, as if holding its breath before the dawn.
